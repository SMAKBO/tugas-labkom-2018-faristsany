<strong>Lactic acid in the human body</strong>

Lactic acid is naturally present in humans, as well as in animals. It is well known that it is formed from glycogen by muscle cells when the oxygen supply is inadequate to support energy production.

There are many misconceptions about Lactic Acid and Lactate in the body. Lactate was long considered one of the causes of both fatigue during exercise and the stiffness felt after. However, on the contrary, lactate is actually an important fuel used by the muscles during prolonged exercise, since lactate produced in one muscle can be oxidized in another muscle. So, rather than causing fatigue, lactic acid and lactate help delay the onset of fatigue and improve sport performance.

<strong>Lactate and exercise</strong>

Lactate has often been considered one of the major causes of both fatigue during exercise and post-exercise muscle soreness. However, lactate may have little effect on either. Moreover, it may help to improve performance.

Accumulation of lactic acid (generated form the anaerobic breakdown of glycogen), in the muscle, occurs only during short bouts of exercise of relatively high intensity and it is usually related to fatigue and muscle soreness. However, because lactate is so rapidly removed from muscle and blood after exercise, it is highly unlikely that lactate is the cause of any resulting muscle soreness. It may be that the accumulation of H+ ions during glycolisis contributes to fatigue during short-term maxim exercise. Oral lactate may postpone fatigue, by increasing buffer capacity of the body and reducing acidosis, in turn delaying fatigue.

On the other hand, it is believed that during endurance-type exercise, the depletion of muscle glycogen causes fatigue. In such conditions, lactate may serve as an energy source. It has been observed that the lactate produced in one muscle can be oxidized within another muscle. Due to its insulin independence, lactate could prove to be a more readily available energy substrate.

Better performance is often related to lactate clearance from the blood. The increase in blood lactate levels during exercise is reduced by acclimatization. Therefore training and lactate supplementation may help to increase lactate clearance and subsequently improve performance.

<strong>Lactic acid in Food</strong>

Lactic acid is naturally present in many foodstuffs. It is formed by natural fermentation in products such as cheese, yogurt, soy sauce, sourdough, meat products and pickled vegetables.

Lactic acid is also used in a wide range of food applications such as bakery products, beverages, meat products, confectionery, dairy products, salads, dressings, ready meals, etc. Lactic acid in food products usually serves as either as a pH regulator or as a preservative. It is also used as a flavoring agent.

    Meat, Poultry & Fish
    Lactic acid can be used in meat, poultry and fish in the form of sodium or potassium lactate to extend shelf life, control pathogenic bacteria (improve food safety), enhance and protect meat flavor, improve water binding capacity and reduce sodium.
    Beverages
    Because of its mild taste, lactic acid is used as an acidity regulator in beverages such as soft drinks and fruit juices.
    Pickled vegetables
    Lactic acid is effective in preventing the spoilage of olives, gherkins, pearl onions and other vegetables preserved in brine.
    Salads & dressings
    Lactic acid may be also used as a preservative in salads and dressings, resulting in products with a milder flavor while maintaining microbial stability and safety.
    Confectionery
    Formulating hard-boiled candy, fruit gums and other confectionery products with lactic acid results in a mild acid taste, improved quality, reduced stickiness and longer shelf life.
    Dairy
    The natural presence of lactic acid in dairy products, combined with the dairy flavor and good antimicrobial action of lactic acid, makes lactic acid an excellent acidification agent for many dairy products.
    Baked Goods
    Lactic acid is a natural sourdough acid, which gives the bread its characteristic flavor, and therefore it can be used for direct acidification in the production of sourdough.
    Savory Flavors
    Lactic acid is used to enhance a broad range of savory flavors. Its natural occurrence in meat and dairy products makes lactic acid an attractive way to enhance savory flavors.

<strong>Lactic acid in non-food</strong>

    Pharmaceutical
    The primary functions for the pharmaceutical applications are: pH-regulation, metal sequestration, chiral intermediate and as a natural body constituent in pharmaceutical products.
    Biomaterials
    Lactic acid is a valuable component in biomaterials such as resorbable screws, sutures and medical devices.
    Detergents
    Lactic acid well known for its descaling properties and is widely applied in household cleaning products. Also, lactic acid is used as a natural anti-bacterial agent in disinfecting products.
    Technical
    Lactic acid is used in a wide variety of industrial processes where acidity is required and where its properties offer specific benefits. Examples are the manufacture of leather and textile products and computer disks, as well as car coating.
    Animal Feed
    Lactic acid is a commonly used additive in animal nutrition. It has health promoting properties, thus enhancing the performance of farm animals. Lactic acid can be used as an additive in food and/or drinking water.
    Lactic acid in biodegradable plastics
    Lactic Acid is the principal building block for Poly Lactic Acid (PLA). PLA is a biobased and bio-degradable polymer that can be used for producing renewable and compostable plastics.

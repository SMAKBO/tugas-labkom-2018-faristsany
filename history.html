 <h1>History of Lactic Acid</h1>
 <p>Lactic acid was isolated for the first time by the Swedish chemist <b>Carl Wilhelm Scheele</b> in 1780 from sour milk. The name reflects the lact- combining form derived from the Latin word for milk. In 1808, <b>JÃ¶ns Jacob Berzelius</b> discovered that lactic acid (actually L-lactate) also is produced in muscles during exertion.[10] Its structure was established by <b>Johannes Wislicenus</b> in 1873.

<br>In 1856, <b>Louis Pasteur</b> discovered <em><u>Lactobacillus</u></em> and its role in the making of lactic acid. Lactic acid started to be produced commercially by the German pharmacy Boehringer Ingelheim in 1895.

<br>In 2006, global production of lactic acid reached 275,000 metric tons with an average annual growth of 10%.</p>
